# React PHP Dev Challenge

This repository contains a simple, incomplete To-do list app written in ReactJS with a PHP and SQLite back end.

Please complete each of the tasks below as if this were a real-world scenario. You can use Google, AI, and ask any questions you like. **This is not meant to test your knowledge of React or PHP**, but to test your ability to adapt and to solve problems.

# Instructions

 1. Checkout (clone) the repository: `git clone git@github.com:ourtownamerica/React-PHP-Dev-Challenge.git`
 2. Install the dependencies: `cd React-PHP-Dev-Challenge` and then `npm i`
 3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>`
 4. Push the new branch to remote: `git push -u origin <new-branch-name>`
 5. Fix the delete button in the app.
 6. Save and push all your changes back to your branch of the repository.

# Tips

 - To build the app after you make a change, run `npm run build`
 - The code for the delete button is in `src/views/home.jsx`
 - The back-end code that handles deleting the item from the database is in `public/api/index.php`
 - **Ask questions.** I'm more interested in your ability to communicate and solve a problem than your expertise in coding.
